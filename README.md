# alternativefeeds
Project on the potential for alternative feed in aquaculture into the future

- Start with information on alternative aquaculture feeds relative to fishmeal and oil components - which are the main substitutable elements of fishfeed 

- Understand how feed conversion ratios and fatty acid ratios may change with alternative feeds and how might this feedback into their impact

- Using available feed composition data what is the demand on fishmeal and crops by 2050 using a business as usual scenario - what will the fishmeal shortfall be based on the current supply of feed - does this change if pigs retain a portion of the fishmeal input'

- What are the gaps that alternative feeds will need to fill for different scenarios? What do the different footprints and fcrs mean for the changing impact - will it be better to do as they suggest in Froelich's fishmeal paper?
